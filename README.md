# Food-Delivery-App

This repository is to only showcase frontend, backend and admin panel in one place.

I am hosting the frontend and admin panel from my different repositories because it's easier than creating different branches in a single repository and host multiple sites.

Only the backend is being hosted from this repository.

Frontend is hosted from another repository => 
https://github.com/JatinRM/Food-Deli

Backend is hosted from Render but it is located in this same repository under /backend folder =>
https://food-delivery-app-gdxx.onrender.com
